# Sorting Application for Animals  
This is a introductory Java Project to show I understand the basics and was challenged to ONLY use the basics while making a application that Army Animals  can use to sort their Animals.

It will take input like types of animals, Breeds, names, dates, birthdays, Army dogs, and if they are stationed. 

Another thing is that this was suppose to be a small assignment but I went the extra mile adding more and more till I felt it was complete.
